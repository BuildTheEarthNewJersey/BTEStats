  /*TODO Implement:
    1. DB Collection name is "Regions" and an object will look like:
    {
        _id: mongo id,
        "name": string,
        bounds: region data (this should be automatically generated with terra),
        complete: boolean
    }
    2. Create region, edit region, delete region function. When creating region, make sure regions don't overlap
    3. % of map complete function -> returns region completed / total region.
    Note: EVERY DB CALL MUST FIRST GO THROUGH VALIDATION
